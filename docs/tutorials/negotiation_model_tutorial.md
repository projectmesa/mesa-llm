# Negotiation Model Tutorial

## About This Tutorial

This tutorial is inspired by the official
[Mesa-LLM Negotiation Example](https://github.com/mesa/mesa-llm/tree/main/examples/negotiation)

The goal here is **not to replicate** the original example, but to present a **simplified and tutorial-friendly version** that focuses on reasoning structure and agent interaction.

Key differences from the original example include:
- A reduced number of agents
- Emphasis on understanding ReAct reasoning output
- No custom tools


## Model Description

This `Model` simulates a basic negotiation scenario involving:
- One seller agent with a minimum acceptable price
- Two buyer agents, each with a different budget

### Each buyer:

- Has a different budget
- Reasons independently using `ReActReasoning`
- Buyers do not coordinate with each other
- Can move to another location

### Seller Agent

- Inherits from `LLMAgent`
- Uses `ReActReasoning` to reason about negotiation decisions
- Considers its minimum acceptable price and the current simulation step


## Tutorial Setup
Ensure you are using Python 3.12 or later.

## Install Mesa-LLM and required packages

Install Mesa-LLM

```bash
pip install -U mesa-llm
```

## Why This Model Is Non-Spatial

Negotiation is a conceptual process rather than a spatial one.
Buyers and sellers negotiate based on preferences, constraints, and reasoning—not physical position.


## Model Execution
At each model step:
- The model advances one step
- All agents are activated using `shuffle_do("step")`.
Each agent generates a reasoning plan using `ReActReasoning` and applies it.
The console output displays the internal reasoning traces.

## Agent Messaging
In negotiation scenarios, agents need to exchange information.
Mesa-LLM supports agent-to-agent messaging, allowing agents to communicate
explicitly rather than relying on shared state.

In this tutorial:
- The seller sends its minimum acceptable price to buyers
- Buyers read incoming messages before reasoning
- Messaging is used only for demonstration purposes

## Creating the Seller class (Agent)
Using the previously imported dependencies, we define the agent class:
The Seller agent inherits from LLMAgent and uses `ReActReasoning` to decide how to respond during negotiation.
It reasons about the current simulation step and its minimum acceptable price.
Use `speak_to` tool to interact with buyer.

``` python

from mesa_llm.reasoning.react import ReActReasoning
from mesa_llm.memory.st_lt_memory import STLTMemory

# ---------------- SELLER ----------------
class Seller(LLMAgent):
    """
    Seller agent participating in a simple negotiation scenario.

    The seller has a minimum acceptable price and communicates this
    information to other agents using the messaging system.
    """

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Initialize the agent using Mesa's base Agent initialization.
        # `LLMAgent` is a wrapper around Mesa's Agent, so all arguments
        # are forwarded to ensure proper registration in the model.
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # across multiple simulation steps.

        The seller:

## Creating the Buyer Class
### Each buyer:
- Has a different budget
- Reasons independently using `ReActReasoning`
- Use inbuilt tools `teleport_to_location` if not engaed with seller

``` python

    purchase is worthwhile based on its constraints and any messages

        self.memory = STLTMemory(
            agent=self,
            llm_model="ollama/llama3.1:latest",
        )

    def step(self):

        """

        plan = self.reasoning.plan(
            prompt=prompt,
            obs=observation,

## Creating Negotiation Model
The NegotiationModel sets up and runs the negotiation between buyers and a seller.
It creates the agents, assigns their roles, and controls when each agent acts.

### How it works:
- Inherits from Mesa’s `Model` class.
- Creates one seller agent with a minimum acceptable price.
- Creates two buyer agents with different budgets.
- Assigns `ReActReasoning` to all agents so they can reason using an LLM.
- Uses `shuffle_do("step")` to let all agents act once per model step.
- Prints the current step number to track simulation progress.
- Repeats this process for a fixed number of steps in the main loop.
``` python
# ---------------- MODEL ----------------
class NegotiationModel(Model):
    """
    Model coordinating a simple negotiation scenario.

    The model:
    - Creates one seller and two buyers
    - Assigns different constraints to each agent
    - Advances the simulation step by step

        print(f"\n--- Model step {self.steps} ---")

        # Activate all agents in random order
        self.agents.shuffle_do("step")
```
## Running the Model
- The `Model` runs for a few steps using a loop.
- In each step, all agents think and act once.
- The reasoning output is printed to the console.
``` python
# ---------------- RUN ----------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an instance of the negotiation model
    model = NegotiationModel()

    # Run the model for a fixed number of steps
    # Each step activates all agents once and prints their reasoning output
    for _ in range(3):
        model.step()
```

## Understanding the Output
Below is an example of the reasoning output produced by `ReActReasoning`:
``` bash
Step 2 | Buyer 2
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[Plan]
- reasoning: Based on my current observation and long-term memory, I recall that my initial offer at step 1 was not rejected by the seller. Considering my short-term memory, I remember that the current budget is still 100, which is greater than the minimum acceptable price of 60. Therefore, I will attempt to make a higher offer, as this may increase my chances of successfully negotiating the purchase.
- action: speak_to

[Action]
- tool_calls:
  1. name: speak_to
     response: 2 → [] : Hello, agent!

[Message]
- message: My minimum acceptable price is 60.
- sender: 1
- recipients: 2
```

## Exercises
Try the following exercises to better understand agent communication and reasoning:

1. **Modify the seller’s message**
   Change the content of the message sent by the seller and observe how buyer
   reasoning changes.

2. **Add another buyer**
   Create a third buyer agent with a different budget and compare its reasoning
   with the existing buyers.

3. **Change buyer budgets**
   Adjust buyer budgets and observe how this affects negotiation-related reasoning.

4. **Increase the number of steps**
   Run the `Model` for more steps and observe how agent messaging influences
   reasoning over time.
